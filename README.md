# Code Refractor

# **The Repository**

My repository for this project is CMDow/01Homework

In this project I take html code that is div heavy and replace it with semantic html code. The purpose of this is to clean the code up and make it easier to understand which portion of the code belongs to certain aspects of the produced website.
